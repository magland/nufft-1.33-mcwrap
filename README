This directory contains MATLAB wrapped Fortran code for the
1D, 2D and 3D NUFFTs. The mex wrapping was performed using mcwrap.

nufft*df90.f contains NUFFT routines of types 1,2,3 with dynamic F90 
workspace allocation.

next235.f contains a utility routine that finds a highly composite 
integer greater than a given number. 

dfftpack.f contains a double precision FFT package from Netlib.

nufft*d*f90.m contains the "help" input/outputs for each routine

You must first compile the mex files by running
> compile_mex_nufft
from within the MATLAB console

Then try
> nufft_tests
to test all 9 routines

The nufft.mcwrap contains syntax that tells the mcwrap program
how to auto-generate the mex source code, which is found in the
_mcwrap subdirectory.
